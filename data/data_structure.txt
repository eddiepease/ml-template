Add your data into this directory to be used by the code base. The code currently assumes the following

* the data is held in CSVs
* the training dataset is called 'train.csv', the testing dataset is called 'test.csv'
* the training dataset includes a column called 'label' which contains the model labels
* the data only contains numerical variables
* there is no missing data

If this is not the case, the code will have to be adjusted, probably in 'transform.py'
